# Lift AI Authentication System

## Overview

Lift AI implements a secure email/password authentication system with Firebase, ensuring Apple App Store compliance and security best practices.

## Authentication Methods

### Email/Password Authentication
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Email Verification**: Required for all accounts (Apple App Store compliance)
- **Secure Storage**: User data stored locally with AsyncStorage
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation with clear error messages

## Apple App Store Compliance

### Email Verification Requirements
- All email/password accounts require email verification before accessing the app
- Verification status is checked at multiple points in the user journey

### Privacy and Data Protection
- Minimal data collection (email, display name only)
- Secure token storage
- User consent for data processing
- Clear privacy policy references

### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to access protected features
2. System checks authentication status
3. If unauthenticated: Redirect to WelcomeScreen
4. If authenticated but email not verified: Redirect to EmailVerificationScreen
5. If authenticated and verified: Allow access to main app

## Security Features

### Password Security
```javascript
// Password validation requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character
```

### Data Protection
- Local storage encryption (AsyncStorage)
- Secure Firebase configuration
- No sensitive data in logs
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Context
The `AuthContext` provides:
- User state management
- Authentication methods (signIn, signUp, signOut)
- Email verification handling
- Loading states and error management

### Email Verification Screen
- Dedicated screen for email verification
- Resend verification email functionality
- 60-second cooldown for resend requests
- Clear instructions for users
- Verification status checking

### Navigation Flow
```
WelcomeScreen
├── Sign Up → EmailVerificationScreen → Main App
└── Sign In → Main App (if verified)
```

## Firebase Configuration

### Required Firebase Services
- Authentication (Email/Password)
- Email verification enabled
- Proper security rules

### Firebase Setup
1. Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console
2. Configure email verification templates
3. Set up proper security rules for user data

## Testing

### Authentication Testing
1. **Email/Password Sign Up**:
   - Test with valid/invalid emails
   - Test password strength requirements
   - Verify email verification flow

2. **Email/Password Sign In**:
   - Test with verified/unverified accounts
   - Test error handling for wrong credentials

3. **Email Verification**:
   - Test verification email sending
   - Test resend functionality
   - Test verification status checking

### Error Scenarios
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid credentials
- Email verification failures
- Firebase service unavailability

## Production Checklist

### Before App Store Submission
- [ ] Enable email verification in Firebase
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify Apple App Store compliance
- [ ] Test on physical devices
- [ ] Review privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Rate limiting considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Verification Not Working**
   - Check Firebase email verification settings
   - Verify email templates
   - Test with different email providers

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Check Firebase console for error logs
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Test network connectivity

3. **Password Validation Issues**
   - Ensure password meets all requirements
   - Check client-side validation
   - Verify Firebase password requirements

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:
```javascript
// In development only
console.log('Auth Debug:', authResult);
```

## Support

For authentication issues:
1. Check Firebase console for error logs
2. Verify Firebase configuration
3. Test on physical devices
4. Review network connectivity
5. Check app permissions and capabilities

## Future Enhancements
